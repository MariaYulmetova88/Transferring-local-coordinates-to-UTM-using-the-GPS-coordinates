# Transforming Local Coordinates to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) using GPS coordinates
## This tool can be used to transform local coordinates to global coordinates when at least two pairs of GPS coordinates are available.

## Suppose you have collected point locations on a total station or electronic theodolite during a survey. You took only two GPS control points when registring the total station. You upload the data to your computer and realize that the entire collection is rotated to some degree and does not align properly with any of your other spatial data. What do you do? 

* re-do the field survey (assuming that time and money are not an issue)
* toss the data and remove any reference to it in your analysis (assuming that the data are not needed for analysis)
* find a way to rotate the data for further analysis

## This tool will enable you to rotate points based on two control points (real-world coordinates). It was used to transform the below into UTM coordinates. Try it out. Give suggestions.
